# 🛰️ EchoHub: The Decentralized Neural Mesh

**EchoHub** is a high-fidelity, real-time social communication platform built with a premium cyber-terminal aesthetic. It serves as a decentralized "neural mesh" where users can broadcast transmissions, establish secure bridges, and manage digital identities in an immersive, dark-mode environment.

## 🚀 Core Functionalities

### 📡 The Neural Bridge (Direct Messaging)
*   **Encrypted Uplinks**: Real-time, private peer-to-peer messaging powered by WebSockets.
*   **The Signal List**: A collapsible contacts sidebar for high-density navigation.
*   **Cyber Terminal Aesthetic**: Immersive chat interface featuring animated scanlines, digital grids, and monospaced data streams.
*   **AI Calibration**: Integrated support for **EchoBot**, a future-ready AI interface (Coming Soon).

### 🌐 Transmission Streams (Social Feed)
*   **Global Explore**: A real-time stream of every broadcast across the hub.
*   **Threaded Lineage**: Conversations are structured as recursive nested threads, allowing for deep, organized data exchange directly below specific posts.
*   **Smart Filtering**: Main feeds are optimized to show only top-level "Broadcasts," keeping the interface clean and impactful.
*   **Instant Interaction**: Like, Reply, and View Lineage (Post Trees) with zero-latency updates.

### 👤 Identity Reconfiguration (Profiles)
*   **Custom Signatures**: Users can modify their Bio, Avatar (via DiceBear API or custom links), and Cover Arrays.
*   **Neural Accent Tuning**: Individualized theme colors that propagate across the entire user's UI.
*   **Edit Identity Protocol**: A dedicated modal for real-time profile reconfiguration.
*   **Network Status**: Visual indicators for verification status (mesh-verified) and network health.

### 🛡️ Root Console (Admin Panel)
*   **System Diagnostics**: Real-time monitoring of total users, transmissions, system health, and bandwidth.
*   **Identity Oversight**: Comprehensive user management table with the ability to verify or moderate signatures.
*   **RECONFIGURE_ACCESS protocol**: Administrators can suspend or reinstate user access instantly, projecting a `SIGNAL_SUSPENDED` status mesh-wide.
*   **Post Moderation**: Direct administrative control over potentially anomalous data streams.

## 🎨 Design System: "Cyber-Frame"
EchoHub utilizes a custom-engineered design language focused on visual excellence and interaction clarity.
*   **Glassmorphism**: Advanced background blurring and multi-layered transparency effects.
*   **Luminous Buttons**: High-contrast "Black-on-Accent" button system with reactive "Power-On" hover effects and icon color-syncing.
*   **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Subtle radial gradients and moving scanlines that make the interface feel alive.
*   **Responsive Mesh**: Fully optimized for various display sizes, with auto-collapsing sidebars and fluid grid layouts.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
*   **Frontend**: React (Hooks, Context API), Vite, Lucide React (Visual Markers), Axios.
*   **Backend**: Node.js, Express.
*   **Database**: SQLite (via `better-sqlite3`) for high-performance localized data storage.
*   **Communication**: Socket.io for real-time WebSocket-driven architecture.

## 📟 Project Objective
EchoHub is designed to feel like a premium, state-of-the-art terminal from the year 2026. It prioritizes **rich aesthetics**, **high-contrast readability**, and **real-time interactivity** to provide a social experience that feels "major and game-changing."
